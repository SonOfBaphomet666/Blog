## Introduction

Published on: 2022-07-02

Design comps, layouts, and wireframes—will your clients accept a more straightforward approach? Many experts in the industry strongly advise against using Lorem Ipsum, considering it a significant no-no.

However, I believe there are some redeeming factors to using placeholder text. Its use often indicates a deeper issue that needs to be addressed.

## What I've Accomplished

The choices you make for that TV dinner pizza slice when you forget to shop, or the makeup you apply to impress a new boss, are your own. But what about your daily bread?

Similarly, while placeholder text can be a quick fix, it's important to consider the underlying issues it might mask. There are valid reasons for using greeking text, as it can highlight a more significant problem that needs attention.

## What's Next

Design comps, layouts, and wireframes—will your clients accept a more straightforward approach? Despite the strong opinions against Lorem Ipsum, it's essential to weigh the pros and cons.

We believe that over time, clients will come to accept a more efficient and direct approach to design. It's a matter of demonstrating the value and efficiency of your methods.

### Key Points to Consider

- **Client Acceptance:** Will clients embrace a simpler, more direct approach to design?
- **Industry Standards:** Are there valid reasons to reconsider the use of placeholder text?
- **Long-term Benefits:** How can we ensure that our methods lead to better outcomes and client satisfaction?

By addressing these points, we can move forward with confidence and innovation.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, while Lorem Ipsum is often criticized, it can serve as a useful tool when used thoughtfully. The key is to ensure that it doesn't mask deeper issues in your design process. By focusing on the bigger picture, we can deliver better results and build stronger client relationships.
